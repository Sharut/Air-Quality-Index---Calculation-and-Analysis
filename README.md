# Air-Quality-Index---Calculation-and-Analysis
This repository consists of the data of hourly pollutant concentration of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO for Bandra, Mumbai. The data is analysed with respect to all these pollutants to calculate monthly AQI and seasonal analysis is performed.  

AQI is defined as an overall scheme that transforms weighted values of individual air pollutants (SO2, CO etc.) into a single number or set of numbers.
Applications:
1. Resource allocation
2. Ranking of locations
3. Enforcement of standards 4. Trend analysis
5. Public information
6. Scientific research
